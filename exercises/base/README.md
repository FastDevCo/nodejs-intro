# Nodejs-intro base

This is where you will build your exercises. Before you begin:

* install all the dependencies: `npm install` (in this directory!!)
* try running the project `npm run`
* try running tests - they will fail - `npm test`
* read through the server.js and try to figure it out
* read through test/test.js and try to figure it out
* go to exercise1 - happy hacking :)
