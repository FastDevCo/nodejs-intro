[nodejs-intro](https://github.com/FastDevCo/nodejs-intro) is an intro level course to Node.js programming.

Before you arrive to the event we'd like you to take care of some basic things:

* install Node.js (preferably the most recent LTS version)
* install npm
* go through the basics of JavaScript (unless you are confident you have JS in good memory)
  * we recommend https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting by [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/).
  * during the event, we are going to work on https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode before starting the actual course material so you can preinstall it and make sure it works.
* `git clone git@github.com:FastDevCo/nodejs-intro.git`
  * please *don't* download the repository as a `.zip` because we want you to be able to easily pull any changes
  * Note: the course has not yet been pushed to this repository, but a `git pull` should suffice at the event.


### How do I know if I have everything ready?

For linux & MacOS, you can try these commands:

```
# should print v6.10.2 or above
node --version

# should print 3.10.10 (or similar/above)
npm --version
```

### Installing Node.js

We recommend you use a version manager that makes it easy to jump between different node versions. Some good ones:

* [npm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* [n](https://github.com/tj/n)

**Windows users**:
* https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
* https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist

### Install npm

* you probably have this already, make sure with: `npm --version` command.
* if not, check google + official tutorials of whichever version manager / approach you used in the step above
